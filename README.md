# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Project Overview

The **Ecommerce-Follow-Along** project is a hands-on guide to building a full-fledged e-commerce application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project is designed to help you gain practical experience in full-stack development by building a scalable, functional e-commerce platform from scratch. 

In this project, we will cover a wide range of important web development concepts including:

- **Frontend Development**: Using **React.js** to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend Development**: Setting up a robust server-side application with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle business logic and API routes.
- **Database Schema Design**: Utilizing **MongoDB** to create structured data models that store product and user information.
- **User Authentication**: Implementing secure login and registration functionalities for users to interact with the platform.
- **REST API**: Creating and managing RESTful API endpoints to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

The key features and functionalities of the application include:
- User authentication (sign-up and login)
- Product management (add, update, and display products)
- Order handling (manage customer orders)

This project aims to introduce you to real-world development practices by guiding you through each step of the process, from project setup to final deployment.
